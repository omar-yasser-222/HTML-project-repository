<p> <head>Mobile app</head> :  is the  act or process by which a mobile app is developed for mobile devices,
   such as personal digital assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These applications
    can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing platforms, or delivered as web applications using 
    server-side or client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an "application-like" experience 
    within a Web browser. Application software developers also must consider a long array of screen sizes,
     hardware specifications, and configurations because of intense competition in mobile software and changes
      within each of the platforms. Mobile app development has been steadily growing, in revenues and jobs 
      created. A 2013 analyst report estimates there are 529,000 direct app economy jobs within the EU then 28 members
       (including the UK), 60 percent of which are mobile app developers.[1]</p>
